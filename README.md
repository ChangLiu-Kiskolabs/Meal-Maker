# Meal-Maker
This is a javascript code block I created when learning about Objects.
# You can use this to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available.
# How to use 
1. Use the.addDishToCourse() function to add all the available dishes.
2. Run .generateRandomMeal() function to generate different kind of combinations, keep running it until youâ€™re satisfied with the generated meal.
